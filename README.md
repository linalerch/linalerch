### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a historian, self-taught web developer, Linux user since childhood, language enthusiast.

I mostly use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, PHP and generally SQL- and server-related technologies, handy libraries such as Bootstrap and JQuery; I am occasionally making changes to Python scripts.

I'm currently interested in NoSQL technology.

Ongoing projects:
- Historia Quick Launcher (published)
  - A browser plugin for historians with pre-saved searchable links
  - Project page: https://extension-historia.github.io/
  - Online demo version: https://extension-historia.github.io/
  - Flagship version Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/historia-quick-launcher/statistics/?last=30
  - GitHub repository: https://github.com/Extension-Historia
- Historical Matrix Online (still mainly unpublished)
